Shell snippets of random value.
Each of the snippets is separate and may have separate authors.
Some are private, some company-provided.

All of them MUST have an OSI approved licence, if copyright
law applies. (Otherwise, theyâ€™re obviously Public Domain.)
For licencing conditions, look into each file separately.
