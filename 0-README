Shell snippets of random value. Not intended to be packaged,
more like aid to developers, training purposes or a code library.
Each of the snippets is separate and may have separate authors.
Some are private, some company-provided.

All of them MUST have an OSI approved licence, if copyright
law applies. (Otherwise, theyâ€™re obviously Public Domain.)
For licencing conditions, look into each file separately.
