.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility cleans the environment pointer, sets a few environment
variables as well as those passed, and runs the program passed.
With
.Pa /
as first option, it first changes to the root directory
.Pq Pa / ,
then operates the same as if
.Fl
were passed.
With
.Fl
set, it cleans even more, i.e. anonymises: only
.Ev HOME Ns = Ns Pa / ,
.Ev LC_ALL Ns = Ns Ic C.UTF-8
and
.Ev PATH Ns = Ns Pa \*(p.
are set then, whereas normal operation keeps the user's
.Ev HOME
and additionally passes through
.Ev LC_CTYPE ,
.Ev DISPLAY ,
.Ev TERM ,
.Ev USER
from the current environment; then,
.Ev HOME
defaults to
.Pa /
if not set in the current environment,
.Ev TERM
defaults to
.Ic vt100 ,
.Ev TZ
is forcibly set to
.Ic UTC ,
and the
.Xr locale 1
utility is used to determine the value of
.Ev LC_CTYPE
to set.
