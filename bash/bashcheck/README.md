bashcheck
=========

Test script for Shellshock and related vulnerabilities

background
==========

The Bash vulnerability that is now known as Shellshock had an incomplete
fix at first. There are currently 6 public vulnerabilities.

shellshock and heartbleed
=========================

I wrote down some general thoughts about recent events and security
in free software:

interpreting results
====================

There's been some confusion how to interpret the results of this script
and some people got scared by warnings on systems that didn't have any
exploitable bugs.

The most important fix you need is one of the prefix/suffix-patches. Upstream
patch number for this is bash042-050 and bash043-027 (patches for older
versions also available). This patch was originally created by RedHat
developer Florian Weimer and a modified version was applied by Bash
developer Chet Ramey.

Once you have this prefix patch all other vulnerabilities are not exploitable.
They are still bugs that should be fixed, but there is nothing to worry
about.


usage
=====

Just run script:
 `./bashcheck`

Patch recommendation
====================

Latest upstream patches (4.3 since patchlevel 030, 4.2 since patchlevel 051)
include all fixes.

They also add prefixing to variable functions (a variant of Florian
Weimer's patch). This protects from further function parser bugs and makes
them likely not exploitable.

My current recommendation: Use latest upstream patches.
