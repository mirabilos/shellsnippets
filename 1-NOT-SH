This repository is dedicated to POSIX (and compatible) shell
scripts. Bourne shell may be admissible, but C Shell and not
shell isn't.

Why not csh? => http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/shell/csh-whynot/

Developers have written lots of code and accompanying data that,
by these rules, is not admissible in this repository. However to
strengthen the spirit of learning-by-example as by the mission
statement of this repository, here is a collection of links to
other repositories which may contain code in other programming
and/or scripting languages, and accompanying data, and websites
with useful information:
